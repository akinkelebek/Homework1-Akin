      <p> Mikhail Tal was one of the most unique chessplayers of all time. He was born in 1936, into a family with Jewish origins, and he would become one of the most reknown Latvians ever. His artistic gameplay, tactical genius, and sacrifices for the sake of having the positional advantage or retaining the initiative (continuing to pose threats so that the opponent would have to defend/take measures) would make him Champion of USSR and then the World Champion. </p>
      <h3>Milestones</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>He beat Josif Ilber and Ratmir Kholmov, both grandmasters at that time, when he was only 12.</li>
      <li>He became the Soviet Chess Champion at 20, youngest person to have ever obtained this title.</li>
      <li>When Tal became the Soviet Champion, he had not participated in enough international tournaments to be titled a Grandmaster. FIDE changed its rules, just for him, as he had beaten many prominent Soviet players on his way to the Championship, and awarded him the title of Grandmaster.</li>
      <li>Mikhail Tal became the World Champion beating the likes of Botvinnik, Petrosian, Fischer (16 years old at the time), and Gligoric, only at the age of 23, making him the youngest World Champion (later broken by Kasparov at 22). </li>
     <li>Tal played a record 86 games without a loss, between mid 1972 and early 1973. He then improved his own record to 95 games without a loss between from lae 1973 to late 1974. (a record he lost to Ding Liren only in 2018, 44 years later, when Liren went 100 games without a loss, albeit with far less wins.</li>

          <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li>Tal is displaying simulatenous games with several opponents, Chicago, 1986. He moves his Rook to f6, sacrificing it to remove the black bishop. His King was hanging unprotected only 5 moves before. You can revitalize this tactical clash here <a href=https://lichess.org/embed/rdKxvnCk>on this page</a>.</li>

      <ul class="unordered-list"> 
        <li>Tal plays Rook xd7, completely undefended, against the World Champion Tigran Petrosian. Tal's motive was, of course, to leave f7 wide open; which he managed and won the game 1 move later. This game was later labeled "Tiger in the Tank". This clash of masterminds <a href=https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1107032>available here</a> in full.</li>

  <p class="p">Tal left this world in June 1992, at 55 years old. His eternal resting place is "New Jewish Cemetry" (Jaunie ebreju kapi), about 30 minutes from Riga Center.</p>
  <p>We should all feel happy to be walking on the same streets on which the genius of Tal was once walking, and visiting the parks in which he was playing chess or just spending his weekends!</p>
